# Credit Risk Modeling - Home Credit Indonesia

## üìå Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Project-Based Virtual Internship** at **Home Credit Indonesia**.  
The main objective is to build a **Credit Risk Model** to support financial inclusion while minimizing revenue loss from incorrectly rejected customers.

### Problem Statement
One of the main challenges faced by the company is that **good customers are being rejected**.  
This issue:
- Leads to **lost revenue opportunities**.
- Limits **financial inclusion**, as eligible individuals are unfairly excluded from accessing credit.

### Objectives
1. **Reduce false rejections** by ensuring eligible customers are correctly approved.  
2. **Support financial inclusion** by widening access to credit for good customers.  
3. **Maintain business growth** by minimizing revenue loss from rejected eligible applicants.

## üìä Data Insights
- Around **91.9% customers pay on time**, while **8.1% default**.  
- Majority of on-time payers are **laborers, sales staff, and core staff**.  
- Customers aged **30‚Äì45 dominate** on-time repayment.  
- Most have **secondary education**, followed by higher education.

## ü§ñ Modeling
The modeling process focused on **recall** as the most important metric.  
- **Why Recall?**  
  Since the business goal is to **avoid rejecting eligible customers**, recall helps minimize false rejections.  

### Key Features
- **Family Factors** : `CNT_CHILDREN`, `CNT_FAM_MEMBERS`  
- **Financial Status** : `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`, `AMT_CREDIT`, `AMT_GOODS_PRICE`  
- **Employment & Age** : `DAYS_EMPLOYED`, `DAYS_BIRTH`  
- **Risk Indicators** : `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_3`  
- **Credit History** : `BUREAU_*`, `INST_*`  

### Best Model
- **LightGBM (Tuned)**  
- Consistent performance on validation and test sets  
- Strong generalization and reliability
